# Specifications for the CLI Assessment

Specs:
- [x] Have a CLI for interfacing with the application
  I have a CLI that interfaces with the application.  It requests input from the user and it is captured and incorporated into my code.  I use the input to pull data that I have scraped from two websites.
- [x ] Pull data from an external source
  I pull data from two websites:

  https://www.foodandwine.com/special-diets/vegan/vegan-recipes
  30 Days of Vegan Recipes

  https://www.realsimple.com/food-recipes/recipe-collections-favorites/healthy-meals/vegetarian-recipes
  31 Vegetarian Recipes So Satisfying Youâ€™ll Want to Go Meatless for an Entire Month

- [ X] Implement both list and detail views

  I provide a list of two recipes for the user to choose each day.  The list is provided for 30 separate "days" (which is dependent on their input about how long they've been eating the vegan meals) to encourage the user to eat healthier.  The user's choice leads them to the url to find more information about the recipe.
