# DailyRecipe

Welcome to your new gem! In this directory, you'll find the files you need to be able to package up your Ruby library into a gem. Put your Ruby code in the file `lib/daily_recipe`. To experiment with that code, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt.

TODO: Delete this and the text above, and describe your gem

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'daily_recipe'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install daily_recipe

## Usage

TODO: The gem is designed to help someone eat healthier and possible even become a vegetarian.  The user is offered two recipes each day for 30 days, by typing ./bin/daily_recipe.  The user provides input about the number of days they've been eating the vegan recipes and selects a daily recipe.  When the user selects a daily recipe, they are given a url to click on that leads them to the recipe.  When the user has reached 30 days of recipes, they are told, "Congratulations, you are now a vegan!"

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
